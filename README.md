# Analysis into tobacco retailers and smoke shops in New York City
In this project, we tried to look into tobacco retailer density to answer how business owners decide to open tobacco shops.

In our analysis, we found that there was a negative relationship between the percentage of Black residents in a neighborhood and the number of tobacco retailers.

This was done for a story for a class on algorithmic analysis for journalism at Columbia Journalism School for the data journalism program.

# There are two parts to the data gathering and analysis

## Original State Tobacco License and Census Tract Analysis
The first notebooks for our initial exploratory analysis is from "pulling-the-census" and "regression-1-clean". 

In those notebooks, we combined state tobacco license data with census data. 

## City Tobacco License Data and Community District Analysis
We regathered the census data here. The first notebook to run is "getting-cb-census".

Then, our initial regression analysis is in "regression-cb".

We did more EDA and census tract analysis in "more_eda" and "census-tract-tobacco-2".

Our analysis on majority Black neighborhoods is in "black_pct".

We plot our graphs for the story in "plotting".
